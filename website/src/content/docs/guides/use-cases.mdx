Kissaten AI is designed for specific use cases where local-first, visual ML makes sense. This guide helps you determine if it's right for you.

## Ideal Use Cases

### Personal ML Projects

**You're a data scientist or developer** working on side projects, learning ML, or building prototypes.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- No cloud costs or setup
- Visual interface for quick experimentation
- Built-in hyperparameter tuning
- Save/load projects locally

**Example projects:**
- Predicting housing prices from Kaggle datasets
- Classifying your personal photo collection
- Analyzing your Spotify listening history
- Building a model for a hackathon

### Small Team ML

**Your team of 2-5 people** needs to build ML models without dedicated MLOps infrastructure.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- Each person works locally (no server to maintain)
- Share pipeline files via Git/Dropbox
- Export models to joblib for easy sharing
- No coordination overhead

**Example workflow:**
1. Alice builds a baseline model in Kissaten AI
2. Exports pipeline file and model
3. Bob loads pipeline, tries different hyperparameters
4. Best model goes to production

### Privacy-Sensitive Data

**Your data can't leave your machine** due to regulations, contracts, or personal preference.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- 100% offline capable
- No data uploaded anywhere
- No telemetry or analytics in the app
- Train on sensitive data without risk

**Example scenarios:**
- Healthcare data (HIPAA considerations)
- Financial data (regulatory requirements)
- Personal data you don't want in the cloud
- Client data under NDA

### Learning ML

**You're learning machine learning** and want hands-on practice without coding overhead.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- Visual representation of ML concepts
- See how data flows through a pipeline
- Experiment with different algorithms quickly
- Understand hyperparameters through forms, not code

**Learning path:**
1. Load a dataset (understand data shape)
2. Configure a model (learn about parameters)
3. Evaluate results (understand metrics)
4. Tune hyperparameters (see what affects performance)

### Rapid Prototyping

**You need a working model fast** before investing in a full ML pipeline.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- Minutes from data to model
- Compare algorithms quickly
- Built-in evaluation and explainability
- Export when ready for production

**Example timeline:**
- Hour 1: Load data, try 3-4 algorithms
- Hour 2: Tune best algorithm
- Hour 3: Export model and metadata
- Day 2: Integrate into application

### Model Explainability

**You need to understand your models** for stakeholders, compliance, or debugging.

Why Kissaten AI works:
- Built-in SHAP integration
- Feature importance visualization
- Partial dependence plots
- Export explanations as images

**Example needs:**
- Explain loan approval decisions
- Debug why model misclassifies certain inputs
- Present model logic to non-technical stakeholders
- Regulatory compliance documentation

### Large-Scale ML

If you need:
- Training on GPU clusters
- Distributed training
- Petabyte-scale data
- Real-time streaming ML

**Consider:** AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML, or custom infrastructure.

### Deep Learning

If you're building:
- Neural networks
- Computer vision models
- NLP transformers
- Custom architectures

**Consider:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jupyter notebooks.

### Large Team Collaboration

If you need:
- Centralized experiment tracking
- Model approval workflows
- Team-wide visibility
- Shared compute resources

**Consider:** MLflow + cloud infrastructure, Weights & Biases, Neptune.

### Real-Time Inference

If you need:
- Sub-millisecond predictions
- High-throughput serving
- Auto-scaling
- A/B testing infrastructure

**Consider:** TensorFlow Serving, Triton, cloud ML endpoints.

## Comparison by Use Case

| Use Case | Kissaten AI | Cloud ML Platform |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Personal projects | Best | Overkill |
| Learning ML | Best | Overkill |
| Rapid prototyping | Best | Slower setup |
| Privacy-sensitive | Best | Depends on data policies |
| Small team | Good | Good if budget allows |
| Large team | Not ideal | Best |
| Deep learning | Not ideal | Best |
| Production at scale | Not ideal | Best |

## Success Stories

### Freelance Data Scientist

> "I use Kissaten AI for client demos. I can show a working model in our first meeting, then export and deploy if they want to proceed."

### Startup CTO

> "We shipped our first ML feature in a week. No infrastructure setup, no cloud bills, just results."

### Student Researcher

> "I learned more about ML by seeing the pipeline visually than from reading papers. Now I understand why hyperparameters matter."

### Privacy-Conscious Developer

> "I analyze my personal health data locally. I'd never upload it anywhere, but now I can apply ML to it."
