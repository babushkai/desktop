This guide covers common issues and their solutions. If you don't find your issue here, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/kissaten-ai/desktop/issues).

## Installation Issues

### "App is damaged and can't be opened"

This is a macOS Gatekeeper issue, not actual damage.

**Solution:**

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/MLOps\ Desktop.app
```

Then try opening the app again.

### App crashes on launch

<Steps>
1. Check that you're running macOS 12 or later:
   ```bash
   sw_vers
   ```

2. Check Console.app for crash logs:
   - Open Console.app
   - Search for "Kissaten AI"
   - Look for recent crash reports

3. Try downloading the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kissaten-ai/desktop/releases)

4. If issues persist, delete preferences and try again:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.mlops.desktop
   ```
</Steps>

### "Developer cannot be verified"

<Steps>
1. Right-click the app in Finder
2. Select **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the dialog
4. The app will now open normally in the future
</Steps>

## Python Issues

### "Python not found"

The app can't locate a Python installation.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
1. Check if Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. If not installed, install via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.11
   ```

3. Configure the path in the app:
   - Click the Python path in the toolbar
   - Enter the correct path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`)
</Steps>

### "Module not found" errors

A required Python package isn't installed.

**Common packages needed:**

```bash
pip3 install scikit-learn pandas numpy optuna shap matplotlib
```

<Aside type="tip">
On macOS with Homebrew Python, you may need:
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages scikit-learn pandas numpy
```
</Aside>

### "Permission denied" when installing packages

```bash
# Use --user flag
pip3 install --user package-name

# Or with Homebrew Python
pip3 install --break-system-packages package-name
```

### Wrong Python version detected

The app might find the wrong Python.

<Steps>
1. Find the correct Python path:
   ```bash
   which python3
   # or
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 --version  # Homebrew on Apple Silicon
   /usr/local/bin/python3 --version     # Homebrew on Intel
   ```

2. Click the Python path in the toolbar

3. Enter the correct path

4. Press Enter to save
</Steps>

## Pipeline Issues

### Pipeline won't run

**Check these first:**

1. All nodes are connected
2. DataLoader has a valid file path
3. Target column exists in the data
4. Python path is configured correctly

### "Column not found" error

The target column name doesn't match your data.

**Solution:**

1. Click the DataLoader node
2. Check the column names in the preview
3. Update the Trainer's target column to match exactly (case-sensitive)

### "Not enough samples"

Your dataset is too small for the train/test split.

**Solution:**

- Use a smaller test_size (e.g., 0.1 instead of 0.2)
- Add more data to your dataset
- For very small datasets (fewer than 50 rows), consider using cross-validation instead

### Training is stuck or slow

<Steps>
1. Check the output panel for progress messages

2. For large datasets:
   - Reduce `n_estimators` for Random Forest
   - Use a simpler model (Logistic Regression)
   - Sample your data first with a Script node

3. For hyperparameter tuning:
   - Reduce number of trials
   - Use Random search instead of Grid search

4. Click **Stop** if needed and adjust settings
</Steps>

### Pipeline results are inconsistent

Set a random_state for reproducibility:

1. Click the Trainer node
2. Set **Random State** to a fixed number (e.g., 42)
3. Re-run the pipeline

## Data Issues

### "Failed to load file"

<Steps>
1. Check the file path is correct
2. Verify the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/your/file.csv
   ```

3. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /path/to/your/file.csv
   ```

4. For CSV files, ensure it's UTF-8 encoded
</Steps>

### "Memory error" with large files

Your file is too large for available RAM.

**Solutions:**

1. Sample the data:
   ```python
   # In a Script node
   df = df.sample(frac=0.1)  # Use 10% of data
   ```

2. Convert to Parquet format (smaller, faster)

3. Close other applications to free memory

4. Use a machine with more RAM

### Encoding issues with CSV

Convert to UTF-8:

```bash
iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 input.csv > output.csv
```

Or detect encoding:

```bash
file -I your_file.csv
```

## UI Issues

### Nodes disappear off canvas

<Steps>
1. Press **Cmd + 1** to fit all nodes in view
2. Or zoom out with **Cmd + scroll**
3. Or reset zoom with **Cmd + 0**
</Steps>

### Properties panel is empty

Click on a node to select it. The properties panel shows settings for the selected node.

### Output panel shows nothing

<Steps>
1. Run the pipeline first
2. Click on a node to see its specific output
3. Check the "All" tab to see combined output
</Steps>

### UI feels slow

<Steps>
1. Close unused pipelines
2. Reduce number of nodes on canvas
3. Clear run history if it's very long
4. Restart the app
</Steps>

## Save/Load Issues

### "Failed to save pipeline"

<Steps>
1. Check disk space:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

2. Verify the app data directory exists:
   ```bash
   ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.mlops.desktop/
   ```

3. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.mlops.desktop/
   ```
</Steps>

### Pipeline loads with errors

If a pipeline references files that have moved:

1. Open the pipeline
2. Update the DataLoader file paths
3. Re-save the pipeline

### Lost my pipelines

Pipelines are stored in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/com.mlops.desktop/
```

If you accidentally deleted this folder, the pipelines cannot be recovered (unless you have a backup).

## SHAP/Explainability Issues

### "SHAP not available"

Install SHAP:

```bash
pip3 install shap
```

If installation fails, you may need Xcode command line tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
pip3 install shap
```

### SHAP is very slow

SHAP can be slow on large datasets.

**Solutions:**

1. Use a smaller sample:
   ```python
   # SHAP will use a sample automatically for large datasets
   ```

2. Use TreeExplainer for tree-based models (faster than KernelExplainer)

3. Reduce the number of samples to explain

## Getting More Help

### Check the logs

Application logs are stored at:

```bash
~/Library/Logs/com.mlops.desktop/
```

### Report a bug

<Steps>
1. Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kissaten-ai/desktop/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Include:
   - macOS version (`sw_vers`)
   - Python version (`python3 --version`)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages from the output panel
   - Screenshots if helpful
</Steps>
