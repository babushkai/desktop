        These entitlements are required for the bundled Python runtime:

        - allow-jit: Required for Python's JIT compilation (ctypes, cffi, numba)
        - allow-unsigned-executable-memory: Required for NumPy, SciPy, and other
          scientific computing libraries that use native code
        - disable-library-validation: Required to load Python .so extensions
          from the app bundle without requiring each one to be signed

        SECURITY NOTE: These entitlements weaken the hardened runtime but are
        unavoidable for Python scientific computing. The app bundle is still
        signed and notarized, providing integrity guarantees against tampering.
        The bundled Python is read-only and all packages are pre-verified.
